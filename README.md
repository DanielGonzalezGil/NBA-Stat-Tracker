The NBA Stat Tracker not only brings NBA data to your fingertips but also serves as an educational tool demonstrating the effective use of Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## Project Objectives

The NBA Stat Tracker, powered by the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#get-all-teams), provides real-time data, offering insights into player performances and game statistics. The application is structured on MVC architecture, ensuring a clean separation between:

- **Model**: The data layer that handles NBA statistics.
- **View**: The presentation layer that users interact with.
- **Controller**: The business logic layer managing user requests and data processing.
